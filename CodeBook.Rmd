The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The goal of the assignment was to create a clean and tidy data set from the data on the UCI HAR Dataset folder.

The variables used in this assignment are :

Where the variable name is formed by 
"VARIABLENAME"-"OPERATION PERFORMED"-"AXIS"
Where the variable names are:
tBodyAcc : acceleration of body
tGravityAcc  : acceleration of gravity 
tBodyAccJerk : body acceleration jerk 
tBodyGyro : body gyroscope measurement 
tBodyGyroJerk : body gyroscope jerk 
tBodyAccMag :  magnitude of body acceleration
tGravityAccMag :  magnitude of Gravity acceleration
tBodyAccJerkMag :  magnitude of body acceleration jerk
tBodyGyroMag :  magnitude of body gyroscope 
tBodyGyroJerkMag :  magnitude of body acceleration jerk
fBodyAcc : frecuency of body acceleration
fBodyGyro : frecuency acceleration of gravity 
fBodyAccMag : frecuency of magnitude of body acceleration
fBodyBodyAccJerkMag : frecuency of magnitude of body acceleration jerk
fBodyBodyGyroMag : frecuency of magnitude of body gyroscope 


And the operations :
Mean = mean
MeanFreq = MeanFrequency
Std = Standart deviation

for example tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X means:Mean jerk signal of body for X direction.
